# Response Summary 02: API Connection Fix

**Activities Performed:**

## Problem Diagnosis
- Identified HTTP redirect issues causing API connection failures
- Recognized that HTTP endpoint was causing "too many redirects" error

## Solutions Implemented
1. **API Endpoint Update**: Changed from HTTP to HTTPS protocol
   - Updated URL from `http://amanabootcamp.org/api/fs-classwork-data/amana-industries`
   - Changed to `https://amanabootcamp.org/api/fs-classwork-data/amana-industries`

2. **Enhanced HTTP Headers**: Added proper request headers
   - Added `Accept: application/json`
   - Added `Content-Type: application/json`

3. **Robust Fallback System**: Implemented comprehensive error handling
   - Added extensive mock data as fallback
   - Created 6 sample factories with complete data structure
   - Maintained all required fields (location, status, contact, etc.)

4. **Improved Error Display**: Enhanced user experience
   - Added subtle warning for demo data usage
   - Differentiated between critical errors and fallback scenarios
   - Used yellow warning instead of red error for demo data

5. **Logic Refinement**: Fixed map display conditions
   - Simplified display logic to show map when factories are available
   - Ensured map displays with both live and fallback data

## Technical Improvements
- Better error logging for debugging
- More resilient data loading
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- User-friendly messaging for different scenarios

## Results
- Resolved HTTP redirect issues
- Application works reliably with both live and fallback data
- Better user experience with clear status messaging
- Maintained full functionality regardless of API availability
