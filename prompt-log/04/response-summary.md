# Response Summary 04: Map Size Enhancement

**Activities Performed:**

## Map Container Updates
1. **Main Page Container**: Updated `/app/page.tsx`
   - Changed map section from `flex-1 p-4` to `min-h-screen p-4`
   - Updated loading state height from `h-96` to `h-screen`
   - Updated error state height from `h-96` to `h-screen`

2. **Map Component**: Updated `/app/components/FactoryMap.tsx`
   - Changed map container height from `h-96` (384px) to `h-screen` (100vh)
   - Maintained responsive width and styling

## User Experience Improvements
- **Full Screen Map**: Map now takes the full viewport height
- **Scrollable Design**: Users can scroll past header sections to focus on map
- **Better Interaction**: Much larger viewing area for factory locations
- **Mobile Responsive**: Maintains responsiveness across all screen sizes

## Layout Changes
- **Before**: Map was 384px high (h-96 class)
- **After**: Map takes full screen height (h-screen class)
- **Scrolling Behavior**: Navigation, title, and factory status sections remain at top
- **Focus Mode**: Users can scroll down to see only the map

## Technical Implementation
- Used Tailwind's `min-h-screen` for container to ensure minimum full height
- Used `h-screen` for map component to fill entire viewport height
- Maintained all existing functionality and styling
- Preserved loading and error state consistency

## Results
- Dramatically improved map visibility and usability
- Enhanced user experience for exploring factory locations
- Better map interaction with more screen real estate
- Maintained mobile responsiveness and professional design
- Users can now focus entirely on the map by scrolling past branding sections
