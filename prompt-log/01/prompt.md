# Prompt 01: Initial Application Development Request

**Date:** Current conversation

**User Request:**

@page.tsx I am looking to revise the page.tsx file to create a mobile responsive application for my fictitious textile factory company. I am providing an initial mockup and data to be used for the application.

Core components:

- I want a nav bar that is dark black with my company initials AM Inc as the logo and a placeholder hamburger menu

- Then in gold background and big black text I wan to have the name of my company Amana Industries written as the title.

- Then below I want a sub-section with a background of pale yellow with black text saying: "Factory Statuses" 

- Below this I want a map using leaflet.js.

- This map should take all the factory locations listed in my api and place indicators. 

- Where the status is maintenance the indicators should be in red

- When I click on any indicator information related to the factory should display in the popup.

- Below my factory map I want a footer in dark gray that says Copyright 2025 Amana Industries

- Ensure the application is mobile responsive and uses tailwind throughout.

- For the data pull directly from the web-source: @http://amanabootcamp.org/api/fs-classwork-data/amana-industries 

API Example below: 

[Large JSON data structure with factory information including locations, production data, contact details, etc.]
